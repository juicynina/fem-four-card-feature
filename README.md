## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Tried using grid for card desktop layout but was much simpler with flexbox. 
- Had to set a min-mmax height and width to the cards, respecting mobile first to get the proper size, if not they would look rectangular and not square. 
- First time usin em and rem for sizing everything.
